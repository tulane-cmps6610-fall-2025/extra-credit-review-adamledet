In this extra credit assignment, we will test and review concepts you
   have learned since the midterm exam. Please add your written answers
   to `answers.md` which you can convert to a PDF using
   `convert.sh`. Alternatively, you may scan and upload written
   answers to a file named `answers.pdf`.



1. **Algorithmic Paradigms**
My favorite algorithmic paradigm is Greedy Algorithms. I feel as though Greedy algorithms are simple to understand: making a choice based on criteria and selecting it into a solution. It feels to-the-point, and it would then make sense that my favorite specific algorithm is Dijkstra's which was our prime example of a Greedy Algorithm (well, that and the fractional knapsack problem). I was a bit torn to include Divide and Conqueor algorithms, but I can become a bit frustrated with them when imagining the many recursions spread out throughout the problem--especially when actually putting the algorithm into code (though it is always beautiful when efficiently written and working).


2. **Divide and Conquer**
Divide and Conqueor problems must have the optimal substructure property. A divide and conqueor strategy breaks your problem into a number of subproblems before recombining them. Each subproblem must be an independently solvable portion of the problem or else it would yield and incorrect answer when broken apart and reassembled. The optimal substructure property, by definition, states that an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
Let us assume we have our divide and conqueor problem, P, and break it into to subproblems p1 and p2. If p1 or p2 is not optimal, then their combination into P will yield a non-optimal solution. The subproblems of a problem P, then, must have optimal substructure.

3. **Randomization**

- 3a. 
The probability quicksort does omega(n^2) comparisons is (2/n^2). For this event to happen, the first or last term would need to be chosen every time consecutively throughout the entire sorting process.
